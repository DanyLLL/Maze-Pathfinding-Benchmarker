## 📚 What I learned

- **Pathfinding & Graph Algorithms** : Taught me how to implement and compare WallFollower, Depth-First Search (DFS) and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a defined maze.
  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** : Learned to properly structure the project using custom classes and operator to cleanly manage 2D movements and cell states.

- **Custom Data Structures** : Built and managed a custom `LIFO` for the DFS maze generation, and mapped the maze into a dictionary-based adjacency list for Dijkstra's evaluation.
  
- **GUI & Event-Driven Programming** : Used `tkinter` to build an interactive canvas, manage real-time visual updates during algorithm execution, and bind user mouse clicks to redefine the placement of the start and end points of the maze.
  
- **Algorithm Benchmarking** : How to use `time import` to track, calculate, and display the exact execution speed of each pathfinding method to compare their efficiency.
